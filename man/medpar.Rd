\description{
%% ~~ description of the dataset. ~~ The US national Medicare inpatient
hospital database is referred to as the Medpar data, which is prepared
yearly from hospital filing records. Medpar files for each state are
also prepared. The full Medpar data consists of 115 variables. The
national Medpar has some 14 million records, with one record for each
hospilitiztion. The data in the medpar file comes from 1991 Medicare
files for the state of Arizona. The data are limited to only one
diagnostic group (DRG 112). Patient data have been randomly selected
from the original data.  }
