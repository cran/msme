	* Version 0.3.0
	Combined the poisson and binomial ML functions into one function,
	which uses the link functions developed under irls, and also
	requires the jll for each family. Needs extensive testing.  Also
	wrote deviance residuals in terms of the jll.  Very happy with
	this, just so long as it actually works.

	* Version 0.2.0
	Added a clutch of ML functions.  Added a new class: msme, which
	will be a catch-all for methods that are general to the book ---
	for example, we can use just one summary function if we plan it
	correctly.  Next I have to massage the outputs and think about the
	link functions and the families.

	Also figured out how to deploy automatic testing, by including
	test scripts in the test directory.  Makes sense, really.

	* Version 0.1.1
	Fixed the residual function for gamma, which had incorrect
	arguments and needed a reverse in sign within the square root.

	* Version 0.1.0 Initial release, with irls and ML for normal
	fitting function and methods.
