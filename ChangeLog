	* Version 0.4.3
	Fixed summary.msme function to produce dispersion.

2013-03-21  Andrew Robinson  <andrewpr@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version 0.4.2
	Added new function 'nbinomial' to fit negative binomial regression
	with some extra reporting, e.g., Pearson residuals.  Extended
	summary.msme to optionally report Pearson residuals.  Added new
	references to help files and rejigged data examples to use msme
	functions.  Now exporting asymptotic likelihood ratio test
	function, alrt.

	* Version 0.4.0
	Released to CRAN.  Functions match the submitted draft.  Most
	functions are undocumented and unexported.  Examples all run just
	fine so book code should all run just fine too.

	* Version 0.3.0
	Combined the poisson and binomial ML functions into one function,
	which uses the link functions developed under irls, and also
	requires the jll for each family.  Needs extensive testing.  Also
	wrote deviance residuals in terms of the jll.  Very happy with
	this, just so long as it actually works.

	* Version 0.2.0
	Added a clutch of ML functions.  Added a new class: msme, which
	will be a catch-all for methods that are general to the book ---
	for example, we can use just one summary function if we plan it
	correctly.  Next I have to massage the outputs and think about the
	link functions and the families.

	Also figured out how to deploy automatic testing, by including
	test scripts in the test directory.  Makes sense, really.

	* Version 0.1.1
	Fixed the residual function for gamma, which had incorrect
	arguments and needed a reverse in sign within the square root.

	* Version 0.1.0 Initial release, with irls and ML for normal
	fitting function and methods.
